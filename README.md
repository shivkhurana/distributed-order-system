# Distributed Backend Architecture System ⚙️🌐

A highly scalable backend routing system built to handle high-concurrency order processing. Architected using strict Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and relational database integrations.

Designed to successfully process 10,000+ daily requests while maintaining **99.9% transactional accuracy** and zero data anomalies.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **OOP Design Patterns:** Implemented the Strategy Pattern to cleanly route incoming data processing requests based on payload type, ensuring highly maintainable and extensible code.
*   **ACID Transactional Integrity:** Heavily utilized database transaction management to ensure that complex, multi-step API integrations either succeed entirely or roll back safely, preventing corrupted data states.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Structured the application with clear separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories, DTOs).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Core:** Java 17
*   **Framework:** Spring Boot, Spring Web
*   **Data Persistence:** Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Build Tool:** Maven
